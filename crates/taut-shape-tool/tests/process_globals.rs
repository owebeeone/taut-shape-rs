//! The process-global state ratchet: `scripts/checks/check_process_globals.py`
//! (gwz-core's checker, vendored byte for byte) over this repository's
//! production crate roots, against `scripts/checks/process_globals_allowlist.json`.
//! A new static with interior mutability, thread-local slot, environment read at
//! the point of use, process-wide hook, or child process that inherits the live
//! environment fails it; so does an allowlist entry that no longer matches, so
//! the list only shrinks. The plan that pays the debt down is
//! `dev-docs/ProcessGlobalsPlan.md` in the glade-wz workspace.
